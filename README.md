## Description
This task was a challenge assigned to us where we create a new version of our portfolio using React. Every developer needs a place to share our projects while applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share our work with other developers. We were not given any starter code.

This week was a little challenging getting everything to work as I had to completely start over because I was confusing myself with the components. I did enjoy taking on this task because it was front end focused and I got to play around with design even though I did not completely finish designing. I hope to come back to this to really make it the way I want and also figure out how to display the individual projects so when you hover over their screenshots, their information and links show.

## User Story
