      <p>
      I am an elementary school educator that mainly works with students with special needs. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2014 with a BA degree in American Ethnic Studies and minors in Diversity and Education, Learning, & Society. I am currently enrolled in a full stack web developer bootcamp at the University of Washington. I enjoy sports, fitness, hiking, Star Wars, gaming, and all forms of art and creative expression. I also enjoy solving problems by thinking outside the box.
